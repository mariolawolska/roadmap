Target: I would like to list my completed tasks and plans for current and future projects. Present my experience paths in a nice and transparent way

Achievements: I built a backend panel for adding, editing and removing milestones in my RoadMap. Using the Laravel 6 framework, I built transparent CRUD which perfectly suited this task.

PHP, AJAX, JS, CSS(bootstrap), HTML, MYSQL DB
